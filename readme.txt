This plugin allows you to control which products should display shipping information on the product page.

== Description ==

You can hide the shipping dimenions on a per-product basis, or disable it from showing on all products. 

In the WooCommerce products edit screen, there will be a new setting in the shipping tab called 'Hide Shipping Info'. Check this option to hide the shipping dimensions on the product page.

To hide the shipping information on all product pages, you can go **WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Display**. Here you will find the "Hide Shipping Info" option as well. Check this to keep the shipping dimensions from showing on all product pages.

= Features =

This plugin pretty much just does one thing, and hopefully it does it well. It is lightweight, and should not interfere or conflict with any other themes or plugins.

* Hide product shipping information on a per-product basis.
* Hide product shipping information for all products.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* WooCommerce 2.2 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Product Fees, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Fees” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
